# Status Report - 29th September, 2021


## What I've done

* The rules of AGB have been (initially) formalised, in `notes/AGBrules.md`.
* The core rules of AGB have been implemented in the simulator at `code/simulateAGB.py`

## Still to do
* Add highlight for the vertices P1 and P2 chose (circle around the node?)
* Animation support for visualisations (Probably want individual images plus the animation)
* Decide on a "good" consistent layout for graph visualisations (Kamada-Kawai is okay for now)
* Implement some more strategies for burning vertices (maybe allowing user input for testing purposes?)
