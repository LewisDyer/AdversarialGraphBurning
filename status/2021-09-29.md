# Status Report - 29th September, 2021

## What I've done

* The rules of AGB have been (initially) formalised, in `notes/AGBrules.md`.
* The core rules of AGB have been implemented in the simulator at `code/simulateAGB.py`
* Initial animation support has been added (really rough/hacky!)
* Experimented with a few different types of graphs (grid/lattice graphs seem like an interesting start)
* Wrote up a quick draft of the outline/description

## Still to do
* Add highlight for the vertices P1 and P2 chose (circle around the node?)
* Decide on a "good" consistent layout for graph visualisations (Kamada-Kawai is okay for now)
* Implement some more strategies for burning vertices (maybe allowing user input for testing purposes?) Core question - considering probabilistic strategies?
* Add logging for output of simulation (number/proportion of vertices burned,
