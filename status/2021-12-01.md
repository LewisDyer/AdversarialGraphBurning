# Status report - 1st December, 2021

(This report is over the last two weeks - 2 weeks ago was just writing up existing work, and last week's meeting was cancelled)

## What I've done

* I've tried a proof that shows colouring caterpillars sequentially leads to the optimal colouring - this proof is a little flimsy at the moment, but the core idea is I use strong induction to argue that if pieces must be fully coloured before starting a new piece, you need to go in sequence, then remarking that colouring pieces partially won't give you any more clusters.
* I've included a brief section on the role of graph diamter in adversarial graph burning, in particular the contrast between colouring a path and colouring a cycle. This doesn't really go anywhere at the moment and I may get rid of it later, but it could be really useful later on.
* I've started a fair bit of work on colouring trees. My main approach so far involves finding the longest path in T, building a caterpillar from that path, colouring that caterpillar, then considering the resulting forest of unburned vertices and repeating the same process on one of those trees.
* As a remark, going for approximate results for trees rather than exact results seems more sensible here - in particular each forest will be adjacent to exactly one vertex in the maximal caterpillar, so the colour of that vertex may impact the total number of clusters - but only by at most 1 colour for each forest we end up colouring, so this error is pretty manageable.
* I still need to explore this further, but I think the diameter of each tree in the forest will be a really useful simplication - in general you can only start one new cluster per round, and each tree in the forst will eventually be fully burned after a number of rounds equal to its diameter. So for example, if I have many trees of diameter 2, I can only start clusters in 2 of them, so I need only consider the "best" 2 trees for clusters, disregarding many other cases.

## Still to do

* I have an initial idea for trees, but it'll definitely need some more time to get the details sorted - in particular choosing which tree in the forest to develop, or the potential of only partially colouring a tree.
* It would probably be a good idea to implement this procedure (along with colouring caterpillar graphs explicitly) - I'll probably do this sometime in Semester 2.
* I think I should start working on the interim report soon (due on the 17th) - I don't think this will take massively long (the hardest section is probably the literature review), but if I finish early I can spend some more time on other things (and slightly tweak the report if need be)
* For the lit review, my main concern so far is there's not much that's directly related to my project (particularly on counting monochromatic components), so I'd focus a lot more on the different approaches used and any particular constraints that previous work includes.
