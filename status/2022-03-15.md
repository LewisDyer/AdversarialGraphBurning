# Status Report - 15th March, 2022

This week:

* Gone through Jess's comments on Overleaf, left replies to most of them (can discuss during meeting)
* Came up with a possible "fixed" proof for sequentially colouring caterpillars being optimal. This involves a more rigorous definition of "colouring in sequence", a slightly different statement of the lemma, which basically says "if you want to find an optimal colouring, you only need to consider colourings in sequence" (this leaves open the possibility that colourings not in sequence could be optimal which is true, but also that we can rely on the caterpillar colouring algorithm to find an optimal sequence). Induction is still used, but the inductive step follows in cases that are underpinned by a triangle inequality.
