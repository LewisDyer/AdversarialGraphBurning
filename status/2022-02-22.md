# Status Report - 22nd February, 2022

This week, I spent most of my time writing up the cycle example of cactus reduction not giving the optimal solution, and attempting to find an more extreme example of this. I tried the example of "sunlet" graphs (cycles where each vertex has one more vertex dangling off it), which isn't all that different overall. On the whole, my current hunch is that it's mainly to do with the number of vertices in a cactus graph that are part of a cycle - for instance, the same "penalty" on the max number of red clusters on a graph exists if you have a graph that's just one cycle with 100 vertices, or a graph with two cycles of 50 vertices connected by a single path. This being said, for small enough cycles it doesn't make a difference at all (for cycles of size at most 9, you don't lose any clusters with cactus reduction).

While doing this, I noticed a very minor mistake with colouring cycles - my current formula says a cycle with n vertices can have ceil (n/4) clusters, but you can only have 2 clusters on a cycle with 9 vertices (I think because, since you colour 4 vertices each round, if you have one vertex remaining at the end, you have to colour it red but it cannot create a new cluster). This should be a fairly easy fix and it doesn't change anything asymptotically, but definitely important to note.

For next week: Look at Jess's comments on the paper so far. I think now would be a good time to start including more diagrams and start to really polish things, especially if the presentation may be sooner than I originally anticipated. (My guess is that diagrams can take a while to get started on, but once I get a good workflow I can do a bunch of them at once). I've been a bit more limited in time for the last few weeks than I anticipated (coursework and marking mainly), but things should calm down a bit again around March.
