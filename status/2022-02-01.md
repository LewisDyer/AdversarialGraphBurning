# Status Report - 1st of February, 2022

* I changed reference of the "path vertices" in a caterpillar path to "spine vertices" instead.

* Regarding Jess's question of the possibility of more than one maximal caterpillar - yes this is certainly possible, though my tree colouring technique essentially fixes a maximal caterpillar once it's chosen, so my current reasoning works (even if some vertices could be in _another_ maximal caterpillar). Though my current definition of maximal caterpillar breaks ties by taking the maximal caterpillar with the most leaf vertices, so for clarity I'm going to remove that point and leave the choice to be arbitrary.

* I made a start on cactus graphs, and in particular attempted to come up with a "graph transformation" that naturally sends cactus graphs to a useful tree that I can colour instead, known as cycle folding (this will be available on Overleaf, but it's easiest to explain with a demonstration).


## Questions

* I'm trying to find a good term for the operation of sending a cactus graph to a tree - I've seen the terms "graph transformation", "graph minor" and "graph morphism" around, but I'm not sure which if any of them are relevant here.
* For cycle folding - The main challenge I'm facing so far is that taking the "shorter" path around the cycle is important (since this means the diameter of the graph is preserved, though I still technically need to justify this), but there's a possibility that I end up losing a lot of vertices on the "longer" path. I think I can use similar reasoning to trees where I can't lose "too many" vertices, or else the diameter of the graph would change, but this could be an obstacle.
* I think I get the idea that a cactus graph is essentially a tree structure with some cycles included, but I'm not sure how to justify that idea a bit more precisely.
* Cycle folding appears to really depend on the "orientation" of the path you're following (are you going from u to v or from v to u?) - particularly if you come across cycles where the shortest path between the start and end points is small, since you will inevitably delete some vertices from the part of the cycle you don't merge. This sounds like a problem to deal with, but equally I think thise could lead to some really nice proofs of bounds on the size of whatever you're leaving behind - for instance, near the end of the path it's clear the structure of the vertices you delete is small to prevent having a new diameter, but you can swap how you traverse through the path and argue the same for the start as well, which should simplify some reasoning.
