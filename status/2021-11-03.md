# Status Report - 3rd November, 2021

* Made a start on path monotonicity and paths being extremal for counting clusters. The challenge here is that adding an edge can make a valid colouring invalid, and vice-versa, so there's no "nice" relationship between colourings here. At least experimentally it still seems to hold, but the proof seems a bit trickier. In particular path monotonicity doesn't imply that paths are extremal over all connected graphs, just traceable graphs.
* Attempted to count clusters on caterpillars - I first started by developing notation to describe caterpiller trees, then showed I only need to consider a subset to count clusters (specifically, only caterpillars where the endpoints have no leaves and the other path vertices have at most 1 leaf).
* For caterpillar graphs, came up with an upper bound on clusters in terms of the number of path vertices. I also showed that, on the subset of reduced caterpillars, the number of clusters is monotonic on the number of leaves.
* I originally conjectured that the maximum cluster counter on caterpillars is the same as for paths of the same size, but in general this isn't true, and in particular the location of leaves can change the number of clusters (e.g the caterpillar 0110010 has 3 clusters, but the caterpillar 0111000 has 4 clusters)

## Still to do

* Finish off the proof for caterpillar graphs - I think the idea will be to break up the graph into smaller graphs and show how many clusters each of them have, though this is quite tedious.
* Take another go at paths being extremal, maybe by a simpler argument of any colourings with more clusters not being possible? (Similar to how I justify that you can't get the colouring RBR in a path, though a bit more involved)
