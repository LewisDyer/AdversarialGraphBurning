# Status Report - 22nd March, 2022

This week I mainly focused on creating the presentation - so far, I'm up to describing the caterpillar counting algorithm. I still need to include an example of this, and then write up trees and cactus graphs. A few main questions:

* Reviewing my work on trees, I'm concerned that my overall bound for trees ends up being 13L/12 where L is the diameter of the tree - this is worse than the most general bound we introduced at the beginning! These results are still useful though (my method splits the tree into a caterpillar and a forest of non-caterpillar vertices, and I get results for the forest which are useful), but I'll need to alter this section appropriately.
* For my presentation so far, I'm not sure about the balance of putting information on the slides vs. just saying it aloud - I think I have the balance right, but I'm not too sure. Also, I think my talk is going to be pretty front-loaded on caterpillars - since the project really builds on caterpillars, I think it's important to make this aspect especially clear, even if it means talking less about trees or cactus graphs. (For those latter sections, I'd rather focus on the idea of "reducing" down to caterpillars, then propagating a colouring back up).
