# Status Report - 22nd February, 2022

This week, I:

* Started incorporating Jess's comments into the first few pages
* Started creating some diagrams for the earlier sections, particularly for caterpillar graphs. I tried a few solutions, but draw.io diagrams seem reasonably effective and more importantly quick!

Questions:
* I'm not sure how to typeset the names of decision problems (where it's uppercase but the first letter is still larger than the rest?) - I've just left them as regular text for now
* In diagrams of graphs (for instance, Figure 1 about colouring a path), I'm unsure how best to show a burning sequence. For Figure 1 I could probably layer graphs beneath each other, but this quickly becomes impractical for larger graphs. One idea I had was to surround a vertex by a circle if we pick that vertex to burn, or potentially just label vertices with a number based on what round we picked them to burn in (we can label a red and a blue vertex the same number without ambiguity).
* Given the time we have left, I'm thinking of taking out the section on general connected graphs, to focus most of my time on polishing the work on trees and cactus graphs in particular.

Next week:

* Read through the rest of the caterpillars section and start tidying that up
