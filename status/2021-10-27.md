## What I've done

* Set up an example with the Game of Thrones co-occurrence network, to consider more natural graphs without the inherent flaws of the Havel-Hakimi algorithm. (This look longer than expected due to some debugging with Python imports/things not working as intended)
* Wrote some notes on "burning sequences", providing a convenient notation to describe any particular instance of adversarial graph burning. I also included notes on the maximum possible length of burning sequences, which gives a useful bound for how many burning sequences can exist.
