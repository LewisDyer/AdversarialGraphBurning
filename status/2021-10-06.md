# Status Report - 6th October, 2021

## What I've done

* Added more logging support for each individual simulation (currently the number of nodes of each type, the final score and the number of clusters for each player)
* Added graphing capability for showing the number of nodes of each type over the course of a single simulation
* Added experiment support, allowing for multiple simulations to occur, and the results of each simulation are stored in a single CSV file
* Some very minor polish in the graphics output
* Made the option to produce images/animations of a simulation optional - as expected this is a huge bottleneck in the simulation process
* Found a paper on counting clusters on a grid in the entirely random case (i.e every square has a 1/2 chance of being one colour) - I'm not sure it's directly relevant, but the ideas within it could be a good starting point. https://sites.math.washington.edu/~reu/papers/current/jacob/clusters
* Ran a few very basic experiments - by the looks of things, with two random strategies the expected score is normally distributed around half the maximum score, which suggests the game is (rightly) unbiased towards either player. I compared the grid and the torus results and their behaviour doesn't seem that different.


## Still to do

* Start defining more strategies for each player - I think I'll start with easy ones that networkx does most of the legwork for (e.g centrality measures), then use those to try and come up with something a bit more involved.
* Read the aforementioned paper more closely - I know it discusses general graphs as well as grids, so this might be a good starting point.
* Maybe try graphing the number of clusters over time (I expect this to start quite high eventually, but fall as different clusters merge together, then increase again as small gaps are filled)
* Add more logging information about the size of clusters
* Try some more experiments on grid graphs with higher degrees to understand how the number of clusters varies (conjecture: it's lower because fires can spread faster, so clusters are more likely to merge together before anything can block them?)
* If I get time, explore some other types of graphs (I'm particularly interested in social network graphs, where clusters could represent "echo chambers" - I know that NetworkX includes a few classical examples to start with)
