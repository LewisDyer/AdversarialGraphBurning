## What I've done

### Development

* Tried out generating graphs using a powerlaw distribution
* Really interesting result: On a powerlaw graph, most combinations of strategies I've tried seem to give a very similar number of clusters to each player - in most cases, exactly the same number. My guess is that this is based on the *graph*, not the strategies.
    * Conjecture: This might be a quirk of how the Havel-Hakimi algorithm constructs graphs from degree sequences. Specifically, high degree nodes are connected to other high degree nodes, while by the time the algorithm reaches the low degree nodes they form new connected components, so each component is close to being its own complete graph - hence, there are few opportunities for clusters to separate.

### Reading

The lit review's quite challenging so far: There appears to be not much research on counting monochromatic components for a specific colouring (though there are a few results on the existence of components of a certain size on *any* colouring for large enough graphs)
* A number of related results for edge colourings, very few for vertex colourings - not sure how much can transfer between them

* I proved the maximum number of clusters for paths on n vertices is ceiling(n/3) - my general technique was to partition the graph into multiple connected regions, indicate a burning sequence with precisely one red cluster per region, then show that any attempt to induce another cluster in a region ends up "merging" with an adjacent region, so the number of regions is the upper bound. Could I adapt this technique for other types of graphs?

Rough idea: I've been thinking about the subset of colourings that AGB produces, but it may be useful to go in the other direction. Given a colouring on a graph, is it producible by AGB?
    * It may turn out that results about the maximum number of clusters on a graph are non-constructive in nature: I know how many clusters there are, and maybe what the final result is, but nothing about what vertices I need to burn in get there.


## Still to do

* Try a more realistic example to get around the quirks of Havel-Hakimi. Maybe the Game of Thrones example from the pyvis tutorial, as a very basic starting point?
* Maybe try a formal proof for the maximum number of clusters for some other type of graph (perhaps caterpillar graphs, or something else path-like)
* It's fairly clear that adversarial graph burning contains regular graph burning (when both players pick the same vertices). I think this connection could be useful later, perhaps for giving some upper bounds, so I think it would be good to formalise this a bit more.
