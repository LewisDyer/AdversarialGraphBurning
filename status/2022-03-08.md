# Status Report - 8th March, 2022

This week, I have: Gone through the section on caterpillars, adding some more diagrams and reviewing some of my proofs. I've added comments on Overleaf showing the main things I've changed/questions I have (In particular my proof that colouring caterpillar pieces in sequence is optimal). I'll try and use Overleaf comments like that each week from now on rather than listing everything in status reports.

Next week, I think it would be a good time to move back to cactus graphs and spend some more time on bounds after cactus reduction: I have about 6 weeks left, with the presentation planned to be in 3 weeks, and in that time I still need to write up the introduction and background, a conclusion, a section on future work/ideas, get the presentation ready, and finish off the cactus graphs section. I think it would be better to remove the intended final section on general graphs and leave that open, since things will likely get a lot more complex there.
