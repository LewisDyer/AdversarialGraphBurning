# Status Report - 18th January, 2022

* As suggested, I've renamed Adversarial Graph Burning to 2-Player Graph Burning, to reflect that the two players aren't necessarily in competition (and the focus in my project is when they co-operate).
* When colouring trees by starting with a maximal caterpillar, I considered the behaviour of the forest not including the caterpillar, and developed the notion of the rooted distance (the maximum distance from the root of each tree in the forest, which is a vertex on the caterpillar, to a vertex in said tree).
* I then justified that, for each caterpillar vertex, there's an upper bound on the rooted distance of any tree connected to that vertex, based on the distance from the caterpillar vertex to an endpoint of the caterpillar. (This relies on our chosen caterpillar being maximal). I also showed that the number of rounds to colour each tree in the first is at most the rooted distance.
* Using this, I proved that the maximum number of clusters outside the caterpillar is the maximum rooted distance on any tree, which has upper bound proportional to the diameter (which is quite significant!). This led to the development of a key heuristic for colouring trees, based only on their diameter (without any explicit colouring involved!)
* The main barrier I have now is to justify whether picking out a caterpillar in the tree is a sensible way to colour a tree (hence why I say heuristic rather than bound) - I feel like any counterexample to this is either going to be really small or really big, so I think I just need some time to explore that and hopefully I'll either find a counterexample or a proof
