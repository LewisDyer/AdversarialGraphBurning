# AdversarialGraphBurning
MSci project on Adversarial Graph Burning - an extension of graph burning designed to model social contagion with competiion.

In 2014, Bonato et. al introduced graph burning, a graph process designed to model the spread of contagion in graphs, such as social influence over a network of people. This project aims to investigate a new variant of graph burning, known as adversarial graph burning (or AGB for short), where two distinct types of influence spread on a graph simultaneously, blocking each other from spreading. This extension of graph burning appears well suited for modelling contagion on graphs with competition, such as companies advertising competing products on a social network.

Many possible directions may be taken in this project. For instance, the notion of a burning number in graph burning, the minimum number of steps required to burn a whole graph, has a natural extension in adversarial graph burning, and the project may involve considering the burning number of numerous different classes of graphs, which may differ depending on whether both players choose to co-operate or not. Another possible direction could be to investigate strategies each player can employ the maximise the amount of vertices that they burn in the graph, and to what extent these optimal strategies may differ across different classes of graphs, or in real world applications.
