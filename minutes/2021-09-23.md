# 23rd September, 2021

Participants: Lewis, Will, John, Jess

## Admin

* Future meetings will be at 3pm on Wednesdays
    
    * Jess might pop in occasionally if she has time, but she's also planning to be around on alternate Thursdays, so we might move the occasional meeting to a Thursday if this is more convenient

    * Will and John planning to attend all meetings, might miss some on occasion

* I've set up a Team so we can share files/have meetings/ask questions all in one place - I'll share the Github repo in there once there's something in it as well

* Project title and description - I'll write a draft and send this over before our next meeting. Shouldn't take too long, just a rough overview of the project to have on the system/explain it to potential readers

## Development

* Formalise the rules of AGB! Try and do this before trying to code it, to prevent any assumptions from creeping through. Maybe look at a formal description of graph burning as inspiration?

* Build a system to simulate AGB - mainly so I can experiment with different classes of graphs/different strategies per player.

* Probably using Python with networkx, and matplotlib with its animation support for visualisations.

## Reading

* If I have time, start going through Bonato's survey paper on graph burning, and identify problems which could be interesting to study in the adversarial variant.
