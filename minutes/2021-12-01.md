# Minutes - 1st December, 2021


* During the literature review, while there are very few papers working on my specific area of research, a good approach would be to consider papers in related fields, focusing on their techniques and constraints on the problems they consider, and justify how my research compares with existing works.

* Referring to "the previous caterpillar counting procedure" will eventually get frustrating, so I should place it in an environment and refer to that instead. Algorithm probably isn't great for this use case - I should probably wrap the procedure in a definition, then have a proof that a solution exists, and that this solution is exact.

* Implementation - remember implementation isn't directly marked, so ideally you should only implement things you're planning to use for research (e.g empirical work later on). And don't worry too much about polish.

* Our last meeting of the semester will be next week - I should try and get a first draft of the lit review in by next Monday or Tuesday, if possible.
