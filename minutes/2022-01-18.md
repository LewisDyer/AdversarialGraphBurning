# Minutes - 18th January, 2022

I discussed my current work, focusing on a proof for the maximum number of clusters in a tree given that the maximal caterpillar is coloured first, and discussed my next main aim of considering whether colouring a tree by colouring its maximal caterpillar is really a sensible idea. William and John agreed that my proof idea seemed sensible, and suggested multiple methods for tightening this bound further:

* Any trees in the forest cannot be rooted to a non-leaf vertex in the maximal caterpillar, since any vertices adjacent to that root would appear in the caterpillar. Hence, trees can only be rooted to leaf vertices, which may justify a simpler definition of the "rooted diameter" of a tree.
* As we burn through a caterpillar, some of the trees rooted to earlier parts of the caterpillar will be fully or partially burned already, which could reduce the number of clusters in the forest even further.

Rooted trees bounded even further (part of it gone while burning rest of sequence)

Now need to formalise this! The annoying bit starts now...
